This repository is for the D3.js assignment for the UCSD Data Bootcamp. The concept of the assignment is to use D3.js to generate a chart that allows for user interaction with transitions. The assignment covers the following concepts:
- Procedurally generating charting elements from tabular data using D3.js
- Using a data source to dynamically change axes scales and data point values
- Attaching event listeners to axes to allow for user-initiated changes to viewing the data
- Applying tool tips to reveal more information from the source data to users

This assignment features a pre-made plugin for the tooltips.
